# Hungarian Method
A toy implementation of the Hungarian Method.
Note that while the input is square only, you can extend the lacking dimension with
all zero rows/cols.

This was an attempt to tune an imperfect algorithm in order to become more comfortable
with optimization tools available for Rust.
There exist better methods and implementations to solve the assignment problem.
